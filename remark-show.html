# MinHooks

A sample application to layout global and local state patterns with a compact version of commonly used patterns.
Global state in React involves a number of pieces some of the main ones being:

* A Flux Style Pattern
* React Hooks
* React Components
* React Context

---
# The Sample Application
A basic CRUD application: create, read, update, delete data and a message system.

The sample application functions to enable the maintenance of a list of widget names.
The user can view, add, update, and delete widgets on this list.
A messages system exists to display messages and can be controlled by the user.


---
# A Flux Style Pattern

One of the critical points of the Flux pattern is a one-way data flow through Action, Dispatcher, State, and View and how the Dispather controls the flow.

A dispatcher is defined with the reducer and its use of state and actions:
```
function reducer(state: StateInterface, action: UnionInterface): 
    StateInterface {
  switch (action.type) {
    case actionTypes.ADD_WIDGET_NAME:
      return Object.assign({}, state, {...})
    case actionTypes.EDIT_WIDGET_NAME:
      return Object.assign(...) },
      )
```

---
# Flux Style Pattern with Hooks
What would be a part of the Flux or Redux library is build into React.

Use the React Hook useReducer to produce a dispatcher from the reducer function. Use a custom hook useAction to produce an action object from the state and dispatcher.

```
const [state, dispatch]: [StateInterface, dispatchInterface] = React
.useReducer(reducer, defaultState)
const actions: AppActionsInterface = useAction(state, dispatch)
```
---
# The Provider
A Provider provides actions and state to the application.
```
const StoreProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  ....
  return (
    <StoreContext.Provider value={{ state, actions }}>
      {children}
    </StoreContext.Provider>
  )
```
---
# The Consumer
Finally the values from the state and actions are consumed by the component.
```
<StoreContext.Consumer>
  {({ state, actions }) => (
)}
  // use state and actions here
</StoreContext.Consumer>
```

---
# Testing
Working with Jest to test React is a relief. 

Unit tests of the pieces, 
ensure the working of the patterns throughout 
development and production. Some of the distinct testing issues that come up 
with global stae are:

* Mocking The Consumer, Producer
* Testing Flow With End to End Testing


---
# Mock a Consumer
Take the Consumer out of the test completely by moking it.
Having a mock like this, that can be later queried for its history is very useful for unit testing.
```
const mockaddWidgetName = jest.fn()
jest.mock('../components/StoreContext', () => (
  {
    StoreContext: {
      Consumer: props => (props.children({
        actions: {
          addWidgetName: mockaddWidgetName,
        },
      })
      ),
    },
  }
))

```

---
# End to End Testing
To really test global state, one needs to use some form of end to end testing. 

I have found that the testing tool Cypress is a great way to approach this type of testing. 

Action and its reaction can be tested, ensuring the global state is functioning in expected ways.
